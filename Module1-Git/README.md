# MODULE 1 GIT

## Context

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Version control is the only reasonable way to keep track of changes in code, manuscripts, presentations, and data analysis projects.
-	Save time: Git is lightning fast. And although we're talking about only a few seconds per command, it quickly adds up in your work day. 
-	Work offline: What if you want to work while you're on the move? With Git, almost everything is possible simply on your local machine: make a commit, browse your project's complete history, merge or create branches...
-	Undo mistakes: In Git, every clone of a project that one of your teammates might have on his local computer is a fully usable backup. Additionally, almost every action in Git only adds data (deleting is very rare). That means that losing data or breaking a repository beyond repair is really hard to do.
-	Go with the flow: Git is used by more and more well-known companies and Open Source projects: Ruby On Rails, jQuery, Perl, Debian, the Linux Kernel and many more. A large community often is an advantage by itself because an ecosystem evolves around the system. Lots of tutorials, tools, and services make Git even more attractive.
